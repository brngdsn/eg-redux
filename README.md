# eg-redux

You'll want to `$ yarn global add nodemon` for the development experience.

# setup

Just `$ yarn` for dependencies (be sure to do an initial `yarn` after checking out either branch).

Then you can `$ yarn dev` to run the examples (which will reload on save if)

# branches

The `sync-101` branch will have a primitive example of redux, and coincides with the Redux 101 powerpoint. You can checkout the `async-201` branch to see the examples of redux with asynchronous data flows, which coincides with the Redux 201 powerpoint.
